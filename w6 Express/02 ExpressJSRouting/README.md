# Express routing

## 1 ExpressJS

Get yourself familiar with the theory part of routing. Then start testing the example in this folder.

You can go and check: https://github.com/expressjs/express/tree/8eb95ae57973b2cbe7778bc2e10450a380ca2efe - plenty of fun with Express & it's features.

The first example is multi-routing. Upload the existing files to your computer and see, how you can get them functioning.

### TODO 1 Test your understanding
Test multi-router and route-map.

### TODO 2 w6 Express Introduction (revisited)
Fine-tune the small API you made last week to work with the different API requests and routes.
